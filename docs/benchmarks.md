# Benchmarks

Measured by [`scripts/bench.py`](https://github.com/SylphxAI/repomap/blob/main/scripts/bench.py) in the [`bench` workflow](https://github.com/SylphxAI/repomap/actions/workflows/bench.yml) on a standard GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runner. Anyone can re-run it.

## Method

- **Corpora:** shallow clones at fixed tags: microsoft/vscode `1.104.0` (TypeScript), rust-lang/rust-analyzer `2026-09-21` (Rust), django/django `5.2.6` (Python) and kubernetes/kubernetes `v1.34.1` (Go).
- **Cold index:** `repomap index <repo> --no-cache`, the median of 3 runs. This covers the walk, tree-sitter parse, import and call resolution, PageRank, Louvain and BM25.
- **Warm index:** the same command with the per-file cache populated. This is what a restart of the MCP server costs.
- **Peak RSS:** the highest resident memory of the index runs.
- **Query latency:** one long-lived `repomap mcp` process, with the round trip measured over stdio JSON-RPC. `search` runs 5 phrases plus the 10 most used symbol names. `context`, `impact` and `trace` (callers) each run on those 10 symbols. The table shows p50; p95 is in the JSON artifact.

## Versus GitNexus

We have not run GitNexus in this benchmark. Its PolyForm Noncommercial licence does not allow use for a company's commercial purposes, and a vendor benchmark could count as one. Its README documents its own performance. You are welcome to run both tools on the same corpora on your own machine.
